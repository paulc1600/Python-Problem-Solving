#  Purpose: Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their books
#           to a page number. Brie can either start turning pages from
#           the front of the book or from the back of the book. She
#           always turns pages one at a time. When she opens the book,
#           page 1 is always on the right side:
#           
#           When she flips page 1, she sees pages 2 and 3. Each page
#           except the last page will always be printed on both 
#           sides. The last page may only be printed on the front,
#           given the length of the book. If the book is n pages long,
#           and she wants to turn to page p, what is the minimum number
#           of pages she will turn? She can start at the beginning or
#           the end of the book.
